Need to show that they are valid transformation aswell:

  This is not obvious that it will always work since the original adversary might
  ask for the ciphertext from the rₑ' supply.

  The argument why this is unlikely (in the paper) is that the construction is
  IND-CPA secure and therefor it is hard to predict a ciphertext.
  suppose that A could predict the ciphertext, then it could use this power to
  win the game. Since he can predict what Enc(m(not b)) is he could just check what the
  ciphertext was and that he received and thereby know if he received b or not b.
